## Project Workflow

### Phase 1: Choose Your Question (Week 1)
### Phase 2: Collect Data (Weeks 2-3)
### Phase 3: Build Model (Week 4)
### Phase 4: Validate & Interpret (Week 5)
### Phase 5: Present Findings (Week 6)

---

## Phase 1: Choose Your Question

### What Makes a Good Question?

**Three Criteria:**

**1. Personally Relevant**
```
Ask about YOUR life, YOUR habits, YOUR environment
Examples:
  ✓ "How does sleep affect my productivity?"
  ✓ "What factors influence my daily mood?"
  ✓ "When do I study most effectively?"
  ✗ "What affects global temperature?" (too broad, not personal)
```

**2. Measurable**
```
You must be able to collect actual numbers
Examples:
  ✓ "Study hours" (can count)
  ✓ "Steps walked" (can measure)
  ✓ "Money spent" (can track)
  ✗ "How happy am I?" (subjective, but can use scale 1-10)
```

**3. Has Variation**
```
Variable must change over time/conditions
Examples:
  ✓ Daily commute time (varies by traffic, weather)
  ✓ Exercise duration (varies by week)
  ✗ Age (doesn't change during study period)
```

### Data Quality Checklist

**Before collecting:**
- [ ] Clear definitions (what exactly am I measuring?)
- [ ] Consistent method (same way every time)
- [ ] Realistic schedule (can I sustain this?)
- [ ] Backup if I miss a day (how to handle?)

**During collection:**
- [ ] Record immediately (don't rely on memory)
- [ ] Check for errors (does this number make sense?)
- [ ] Track context (note unusual circumstances)
- [ ] Stay consistent (same time, same method)

**After collection:**
- [ ] Review all data (any obvious errors?)
- [ ] Calculate summary stats (mean, range, etc.)
- [ ] Spot check quality (random verification)
- [ ] Organize for analysis (spreadsheet or CSV)

---

### Common Data Collection Mistakes

**❌ Mistake 1: Too Ambitious**
```
Bad: "Track 20 variables for 6 months"
Good: "Track 2-3 variables for 3-4 weeks"

Reality: Start small, can expand later
```

**❌ Mistake 2: Inconsistent Methods**
```
Bad: Sometimes rate energy when waking, sometimes at noon
Good: Always rate energy at exactly 8 AM

Consistency is critical!
```

**❌ Mistake 3: Forgetting Context**
```
Bad: Just numbers with no notes
Good: Note unusual days (exam, sick, trip)

Context helps interpret outliers
```

**❌ Mistake 4: Waiting Too Long to Record**
```
Bad: "I'll remember tonight what I ate for lunch"
Good: Record immediately or take photo

Memory is unreliable!
```

---

## Phase 3: Build Model

### Analyze Your Data

**Step 1: Organize Data**

Create a spreadsheet or CSV:

```
day,sleep_hours,energy_rating
1,7.5,7
2,6.0,5
3,8.5,8
4,7.0,7
5,5.5,4
...
```

---

**Step 2: Explore Data**

**Calculate basic statistics:**
```
Sleep hours:
  Mean: ______
  Min: ______
  Max: ______
  Range: ______

Energy rating:
  Mean: ______
  Min: ______
  Max: ______
  Range: ______
```

**Create initial visualization:**
```
Scatter plot: Sleep (x-axis) vs Energy (y-axis)
What pattern do you see?
  - Positive relationship? (more sleep → more energy)
  - Negative relationship? (more sleep → less energy)
  - No relationship? (scattered randomly)
  - Non-linear? (curved pattern)
```

---

**Step 3: Build Regression Model**

**Manual Calculation (showing your work):**

```
Step 1: Calculate means
  x̄ (sleep mean) = Σx / n = ______
  ȳ (energy mean) = Σy / n = ______

Step 2: Calculate deviations
  For each observation:
    (x - x̄) and (y - ȳ)
    
Step 3: Calculate slope
  b = Σ[(x - x̄)(y - ȳ)] / Σ[(x - x̄)²]
    = ______ / ______
    = ______

Step 4: Calculate intercept
  a = ȳ - b × x̄
    = ______ - ______ × ______
    = ______

Step 5: Write equation
  Energy = ______ + ______ × Sleep
```

**Interpretation:**
```
Slope (b = ______):
  Meaning: Each additional hour of sleep changes energy by ______ points
  
Intercept (a = ______):
  Meaning: Predicted energy with 0 hours sleep (not realistic!)
  Or: Baseline energy level
```

---

**Step 4: Evaluate Model**

**Calculate R²:**
```
Step 1: Calculate predictions
  For each observation: ŷ = a + b × x

Step 2: Calculate residuals
  For each observation: ε = y - ŷ

Step 3: Calculate sum of squares
  TSS = Σ(y - ȳ)² = ______
  RSS = Σ(ε)² = ______
  ESS = TSS - RSS = ______

Step 4: Calculate R²
  R² = ESS / TSS = ______ / ______ = ______
  
  R² = ______% (percentage of variance explained)
```

**What does R² mean?**
```
R² = 0.90-1.00: Excellent fit (90-100% explained)
R² = 0.70-0.90: Good fit (70-90% explained)
R² = 0.50-0.70: Moderate fit (50-70% explained)
R² = 0.30-0.50: Weak fit (30-50% explained)
R² < 0.30: Very weak fit (<30% explained)

Your R² = ______: ____________ fit
```

---

**Step 5: Check Residuals**

**Create residual plot:**
```
Plot predicted values (x-axis) vs residuals (y-axis)

Look for:
  ✓ Random scatter around zero (good!)
  ✗ Pattern or curve (bad - model wrong)
  ✗ Funnel shape (bad - variance not constant)
  ✗ Outliers (investigate!)
```

**Identify outliers:**
```
Which observations have largest residuals?
Day ___: Residual = _____ (why?)
Day ___: Residual = _____ (why?)

Were these unusual days?
Should they be excluded?
```

---

## Phase 4: Validate & Interpret

### Validate Your Model

**Cross-Validation (if enough data):**
```
If you have 30+ observations:

1. Split data: 70% training, 30% testing
   Training: Use to build model (calculate a, b)
   Testing: Validate model (check predictions)

2. Build model on training data
   Calculate slope and intercept

3. Test on holdout data
   Predict y for test observations
   Calculate test R²
   
4. Compare:
   Training R² = ______
   Testing R² = ______
   
   If similar → Good! Model generalizes
   If test << training → Overfit! Model too specific
```

**Sensitivity Analysis:**
```
What if I exclude the outlier(s)?
  R² without outlier = ______
  Slope without outlier = ______
  
Does model change dramatically?
  - If YES → That point very influential
  - If NO → Model robust
```

---

### Interpret Your Results

**Answer Your Original Question:**

```
Research question: _________________________________

Answer based on model:
_________________________________________________
_________________________________________________
_________________________________________________

Supporting evidence:
  - Slope = ______ means ______________________
  - R² = ______ means ________________________
  - Residual analysis shows ___________________
```

**Biological/Practical Interpretation:**

```
Does the relationship make sense?

Mechanism: WHY does X affect Y?
_________________________________________________
_________________________________________________

Practical application: What can I DO with this?
_________________________________________________
_________________________________________________

Limitations: What is my model missing?
_________________________________________________
_________________________________________________
```

---

**Example Interpretation (Sleep vs Energy):**

```
Question: "How does sleep affect my energy level?"

Model: Energy = 2.5 + 0.8 × Sleep (R² = 0.73)

Interpretation:
- Each hour of sleep increases energy by 0.8 points (on 1-10 scale)
- Model explains 73% of daily energy variation
- Sleep is main driver, but 27% due to other factors

Mechanism:
- Sleep allows body/brain recovery
- More sleep → better cognitive function → higher energy
- Biological basis: circadian rhythm, adenosine clearance

Practical application:
- To feel energetic, need ~7-8 hours sleep
- Staying up late (6 hours) costs ~1.6 energy points
- Prioritize sleep before important days

Limitations:
- Doesn't account for sleep quality (deep vs light)
- Other factors matter: stress, exercise, diet, caffeine
- Linear model might not work at extremes (12+ hours?)
- Self-reported energy (subjective, might be biased)
```

## Example Projects (Student Work)

### Example 1: Coffee and Focus

**Student:** Priya, 3rd year Biology

**Question:** "How does coffee consumption affect my concentration?"

**Variables:**
- Y: Concentration score (tasks completed per hour)
- X: Cups of coffee consumed that morning

**Data:** 30 days of tracking

**Model:** Concentration = 8.5 + 2.3 × Coffee (R² = 0.61)

**Finding:** Each cup of coffee increased productivity by 2.3 tasks/hour, but relationship weakened after 3 cups (non-linear at extremes)

**Insight:** "I discovered I was drinking too much coffee (4-5 cups)! My optimal is 2-3 cups. Now I'm more productive with less caffeine."

---

### Example 2: Exercise and Mood

**Student:** Rahul, 2nd year Computer Science

**Question:** "Does daily exercise improve my mood?"

**Variables:**
- Y: Mood rating (1-10 scale, evening)
- X: Minutes of exercise (any type)

**Data:** 45 days of tracking

**Model:** Mood = 5.2 + 0.08 × Exercise (R² = 0.52)

**Finding:** Each 10 minutes of exercise increased mood by 0.8 points. Effect strongest for 30-45 minutes (diminishing returns after that).

**Insight:** "I used to skip exercise when stressed. But my model showed those were exactly the days I needed it most! Now I do 30 min even on busy days."

---

### Example 3: Study Time Optimization

**Student:** Ananya, 1st year Mathematics

**Question:** "What time of day am I most efficient at studying?"

**Variables:**
- Y: Pages read per hour
- X: Hour of day (coded: morning=1, afternoon=2, evening=3)

**Data:** 60 study sessions over 4 weeks

**Model:** Pages = 15.2 - 3.4 × TimeOfDay (R² = 0.48)

**Finding:** Morning sessions averaged 15 pages/hour, afternoon 12, evening 8. Significant decline throughout day.

**Insight:** "I'm a morning person! I restructured my schedule to tackle hardest subjects 8-11 AM. My grades improved significantly."

## Tips for Success

### Do's ✅

**DO: Start simple**
```
One predictor, one outcome
Can always expand later
Simple models often best!
```

**DO: Collect consistently**
```
Same time, same method, every day
Quality > quantity
20 good observations > 50 sloppy ones
```

**DO: Visualize first**
```
Plot data before calculating
Patterns obvious in plots
Catches errors early
```

**DO: Interpret thoughtfully**
```
What does this MEAN for your life?
Not just numbers - insights!
Connect math to reality
```

**DO: Embrace imperfection**
```
R² = 0.5 is valuable!
You learned something new
Perfect models rare in real life
```

---

### Don'ts ❌

**DON'T: Make it too complex**
```
Avoid: 10 predictors, interactions, polynomials
Stick to: Simple linear regression
Advanced methods for later!
```

**DON'T: Cherry-pick data**
```
Include all observations
Don't exclude "bad" days just because
Outliers might be most interesting!
```

**DON'T: Trust model blindly**
```
Always check: Does this make sense?
Biological plausibility matters
Math alone isn't enough
```

**DON'T: Extrapolate wildly**
```
If you collected 5-9 hours sleep data
Don't predict what happens at 15 hours!
Stay within data range
```

**DON'T: Ignore limitations**
```
Every model has weaknesses
Acknowledge them!
Shows scientific maturity
```

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: What if I can't collect data for 3-4 weeks?**
```
A: Retrospective data works!
   - Phone usage logs (past month)
   - Bank statements (past expenses)
   - Old test scores (past semester)
   - Social media activity (download your data)
   
   Just ensure you have 20+ observations
```

**Q: What if my R² is really low (like 0.2)?**
```
A: That's still valuable!
   - You learned X explains only 20% (important!)
   - Means other factors matter more (what are they?)
   - Low R² often most interesting findings
   - "Sleep doesn't affect my mood much" is a discovery!
```

**Q: Can I use categorical predictors (like day of week)?**
```
A: Yes, with coding!
   - Weekend = 1, Weekday = 0
   - Or: Monday=1, Tuesday=2, ... Sunday=7
   - Treat as numerical in regression
   - But interpretation slightly different
```

**Q: What if my data shows no relationship at all?**
```
A: Perfect! You discovered something!
   - Null result is still a result
   - Means your hypothesis was wrong (learning!)
   - Try different predictor
   - Or: Maybe relationship is non-linear?
```

**Q: Can I work in a team?**
```
A: Ask your instructor
   - Generally: data collection can be shared
   - But: everyone should analyze independently
   - Collaboration on ideas OK, copying calculations NOT OK
```
